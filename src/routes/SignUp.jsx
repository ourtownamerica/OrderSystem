			<div className="highlight-warning">
				<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, CHANNEL PARTNER
				ACKNOWLEDGES READ AND UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
				AGREEMENT, AND AGREES TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THEM.
			</div>
			<p>
				These TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS (the "Agreement") are an agreement between Our
				Town America, a Franchising Corporation, a Florida corporation ("OTA"), and
				the customer specified on the ordering documents (the "Channel
				Partner/Client/Client"/you/your) used by customer for placing its order (the
				"Order Form"), and contains the terms and conditions that govern Channel
				Partners purchase and receipt of OTA's products and services as set forth in
				the Order Form.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Agreement takes effect when Channel Partner clicks an "Accept,"
				"Agree," "Continue," or similar check box or button presented with this
				Agreement. THE INDIVIDUAL ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE
				CLIENT REPRESENTS TO OTA THAT HE/SHE HAS LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND THE CLIENT.
			</p>
			<p>
				OTA provides to local businesses direct mail marketing materials and
				services that promote the local businesses to individuals and families that
				are new movers or that have indicated a change of address using products and
				services, including but not limited to postcard and digital advertising for
				direct mail advertising and marketing the businesses.
			</p>
			<h2>1. SERVICES AND PRODUCTS</h2>
			<h3>A. NEW MOVER MARKETING PROGRAM</h3>
			<p>
				Although OTA takes great measures to produce the best list of new customers
				available, errors will occur. If documented errors in any one mailing exceed
				8% of the mailed names, the local franchisee of OTA (the "Company") will
				issue a credit for the amount exceeding 8%. OTA retains ownership of all
				names derived from mailing or barcode scanning.
			</p>
			<p>
				A Channel Partner is invoiced upon receipt by the Company of the names of
				the current change of address counts, and payment is due upon Channel
				Partners receipt of the invoice. Exclusivity is per Household, based on the
				features chosen within this Agreement. Unused Households of the selected
				area not fully selected may be sold to the same OTIC Code noted above. This
				Agreement shall be binding on Channel Partner successors and assigns.
			</p>
			<h3>B. POSTCARD</h3>
			<p>
				The backside template (shown on the Order Form) reflects current USPS Postal
				Requirements and these requirements allow for the proper automated handling
				of your postcards. Please make sure your backside layout complies with this
				template if mailing your postcards.
			</p>
			<h3>C. DIGITAL MARKETING</h3>
			<p>
				You shall provide assistance, technical information and decisions to OTA, as
				reasonably required by OTA in sufficient time to facilitate the execution of
				marketing efforts. You agree to work closely with OTA to provide regular
				information and feedback so OTA can create fresh content and make
				adjustments to the marketing efforts accordingly.
			</p>
			<p>
				This assistance includes providing necessary login information and passwords
				to access social media, analytics, hosting, domains, and other third-party
				accounts necessary for OTA to carry out marketing efforts. OTA will provide
				social media marketing, pay per click, retargeting, and other types of
				digital ads across multiple platforms including Meta, Instagram, Google,
				YouTube and other sites.
			</p>
			<h4>i. Client Data</h4>
			<p>
				You retain ownership in your data entered in connection with the Services
				("Client Data"). Channel Partner grants OTA a non-exclusive license to
				store, record, transmit, maintain, display, use, post, distribute and modify
				Channel Partner's Data for the purpose to providing the Services in
				accordance with this Agreement.
			</p>
			<p>
				OTA will not share Channel Partner Data with any business other than in the
				course of securing online advertising and marketing services on your behalf.
				OTA has the right to place information pertaining to your business on any of
				the social media such as those listed above, and authorize OTA develop
				content based on information or material provided by you or your designees
				and collected by OTA including copy, form, size, text, graphics, names,
				addresses, phone numbers, URLs, logos, trade names, trademarks, service
				marks, endorsements, photographs or likenesses. Further, You represent that
				the material and information provided to OTA is truthful, not misleading,
				and that you have the authority to represent this product and service
				information to OTA.
			</p>
			<h4>ii. Data Protection</h4>
			<p>
				OTA will treat Channel Partner Data as confidential information and will
				take reasonable commercial efforts to secure and protect Sponsor/Client Data
				against unauthorized access or disclosure and will not use Sponsor/Client
				Data except as permitted in this Agreement and our{" "}
				<a href="https://www.ourtownamerica.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">
					Privacy Policy
				</a>
				.
			</p>
			<p>
				Except for Channel Partner Data, all content including new customer
				information and features of the services are OTA's confidential and
				proprietary information (collectively, "Confidential Information"). Channel
				Partner may use such Confidential Information only in connection with its
				use of the Services as permitted under this Agreement. Channel Partner will
				not disclose Confidential Information during the term of this Agreement or
				any time following the end of such term. Channel Partner will take all
				reasonable measures to avoid disclosure, dissemination, or unauthorized use
				of Confidential Information, including, at a minimum, those measures Channel
				Partner takes to protect its own most confidential information.
			</p>
			<h2>2. ACCURACY OF PRODUCTS</h2>
			<h3>A. LAYOUT</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>
					You are 100% responsible for the accuracy of your layouts submitted to
					OTA.
				</strong>{" "}
				Please proofread all layouts carefully. All layouts assembled by OTA will
				have{" "}
				<a href="http://www.ourtownamerica.com" target="_blank">
					www.ourtownamerica.com
				</a>{" "}
				printed in 5pt. font on the backside of the card.
			</p>
			<p>
				OTA reserves the right to refuse to print any material that OTA determines,
				in its sole discretion, is immoral, illegal, or inappropriate for
				distribution in the United States Postal Service mail stream. If your
				material is deemed unacceptable, you will be notified promptly and permitted
				to change the content or layout to fit our requirements.
			</p>
			<h3>B. COLOR</h3>
			<p>
				OTA will reproduce color from submitted photos or digital layouts as closely
				and accurately as possible. OTA accepts no responsibility for color
				variations between submitted images and the artwork or product they
				represent. All colors contained within any CMYK digital file will be
				converted to OTA's RGB color space, which may cause the CMYK colors to
				change due to color space differences.
			</p>
			<p>
				The colors on the printed cards may differ from what you see displayed when
				viewing your layout via OTA's online final approval process. The online
				proof only presents the design layout, text accuracy, image proportion and
				placement, but not color or density.
			</p>
			<h2>3. PAYMENT</h2>
			<p>
				The fees for OTA Products and Services, which include the cost of
				processing, printing, shipping and/or mailing, and any other charges
				applicable, are due and payable together with the submission of an order.
				The company reserves the right to automatically, without prior notice, pass
				along to Channel Partner all postal and production rate increases.
			</p>
			<div className="highlight-warning">
				<strong>Payment Terms:</strong> OTA requires 100% payment one week before
				mailing. Orders will be mailed once payment has been received.
			</div>
			<p>
				OTA will invoice Channel Partner for the fees. Channel Partner is
				responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact
				information about notifying OTA of any changes to such information. If the
				Channel Partner wishes to dispute any fees contained in an invoice, They
				must notify the OTA in writing within five (5) business days. Failure to do
				so will result in the invoice being deemed correct, and the Channel Partner
				will waive its right to dispute it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any amount due to OTA which is not paid may result in non-delivery of the
				order, and unpaid amounts beyond 30 days are subject to 1.75% interest per
				month or the highest rate as allowed by law, if less, and a late fee of $20
				per month. Sponsor/Clients are responsible for all related collection costs,
				legal fees and interest.
			</p>
			<h2>4. SALES TAX POLICY</h2>
			<p>OTA is required to collect sales tax on purchases shipped to Florida.</p>
			<h2>5. REFUNDS &amp; CANCELLATION</h2>
			<div className="highlight-warning">
				<strong>No Refunds:</strong> No refunds of any nature will be granted once
				OTA begins your order. Additionally, no partial refunds will be provided for
				work not completed and design and set up fees may still apply and be
				charged.
			</div>
			<p>
				All refunds, due to an overpayment on a particular account, are available
				upon the Channel Partner's reasonable request.
			</p>

			<p>
				Quoted Production Times start only after OTA receives final approval of your
				layout and full payment. All correspondence regarding the order must include
				the order number (in the subject line of an email) to avoid any delays in
				production.

			<p>
				Expected delivery date and Production Times are not guaranteed. Your order
				may arrive late due to unforeseen delays in delivery service, natural
				disaster, the breakdown of equipment, bad weather, etc. OTA is not liable
				for damage caused by any service carrier.
			</p>
			<h2>7. TERM; TERMINATION</h2>
			<p>
				The initial term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and
				continues as described in the applicable Order Form. If Channel Partner
				materially breaches any of its duties or obligations in this Agreement and

				sends written notice thereof (by mail, electronic mail, or fax), this
				Agreement shall terminate and all amounts due for the remainder of the
				current term shall be immediately due and payable.
