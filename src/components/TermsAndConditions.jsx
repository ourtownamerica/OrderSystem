				These TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS (the “Agreement”) are an agreement between
				Our Town America, a Franchising Corporation, a Florida corporation
				(“OTA”), and the customer specified on the ordering documents (the
				“Sponsor/Client/Client”/you/your) used by customer for placing its order
				(the “Order Form”), and contains the terms and conditions that govern
				Sponsor/Client’s purchase and receipt of OTA’s products and services as
				set forth in the Order Form.<span>&nbsp; </span>Capitalized terms not
				defined herein shall, unless otherwise indicated herein, have the meanings
				ascribed to such terms in the applicable Order Form.
			</span>

				This Agreement takes effect (each, to “Accept” and the date upon which
				Sponsor/Client Accepts this Agreement is the “Effective Date”): (a) when
				Sponsor/Client clicks an “Accept,” “Agree,” “Continue,” or similar check
				box or button presented with this Agreement. THE INDIVIDUAL ENTERING INTO
				THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF SPONSOR/CLIENT REPRESENTS TO OTA THAT HE/SHE
				HAS LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND SPONSOR/CLIENT.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span>
				BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, SPONSOR/CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
				SPONSOR/CLIENT HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
				THIS AGREEMENT, AND AGREES TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THEM. IF SPONSOR/CLIENT
				DOES NOT AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
				AGREEMENT, THEN OTA WILL NOT PROVIDE THE PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES.

				OTA provides to local businesses direct mail marketing materials and
				services that promote the local businesses to individuals and families
				that are new movers or that have indicated a change of address or address
				data <span>provided(</span>the “Services”), using products and services,

				<span>NEW MOVER MARKETING PROGRAM: </span>
			</b>
			<span>
				Although OTA takes great measures to produce the best list of new
				customers available, errors will occur. If documented errors in
				<span>any one</span> mailing exceed 8% of the mailed names, the local
				franchisee of OTA (the “Company”) will issue a credit for the amount
				exceeding 8%. OTA retains ownership of all names derived from mailing or
				barcode scanning. Sponsor/Client is invoiced upon receipt by the Company
				of the names of the current change of address counts and payment is due
				upon Sponsor/Client’s receipt of invoice. Failure to honor the
				Sponsor/Client gift certificates issued by OTA will cause irreparable harm
				to the business and reputation of the Company and OTA and other
				Sponsor/Clients utilizing OTA Services and will result in the immediate
				termination of this Agreement. In this case, all amounts due under this
				Agreement for the remainder of the then current term shall be immediately
				due and payable to OTA. Sponsor/Client acknowledges that if it chooses the
				Trial term and a competitor of Sponsor/Client selects the Exclusive Term
				in Sponsor/Client’s mailing area(s) at any time during the term of this
				Agreement, Sponsor/Client may lose the mailing area(s) that are in
				conflict. Sponsor/Client will be provided with a notice of any changes in
				mailing area(s) <span>as a result of</span> this policy. Exclusivity is
				per Household, based on the features chosen within this Agreement. Unused
				Households of the selected area not fully selected may be sold to the same
				OTIC Code noted above. This Agreement shall be binding on Sponsor/Client’s
				successors and assigns.
